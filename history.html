    <h1>Herb Aach History</h1>

    <p>
      Herb Aach is best known for his fascination with color theory, including phases of color, perception, and fluorescence.
      His abstract paintings largely consist of geometric variations. He was a professor of art at Queens College and was chairman of the art department
      from 1976 to 1979. He was also New York's colour consultant on painting its bridges. He also edited and published an american translation of
      Goethe's Colour Theory in 1971.
